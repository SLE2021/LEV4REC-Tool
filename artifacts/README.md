## LEV4REC Artifacts

This folder contains all the produced artifacts shown in the paper. There are two kinds of artifacts *i)* the complete models devised by using graphical utilities and *ii)* the generated Jupyter notebook for the two RSs presented in the empirical evaluation. 
Concerning the designed models, the **LEV4REC_feature_model.png** represents the complete feature model used to set the constraints. The metamodel used to represent the abstract RS concepts is depicted in **LEV4REC_meta_model.png**. 

The empirical evaluation follows this structure:
```
 	|--- Aurora
		|--- Aurora.ipynb	The generated Jupyter Notebook for Aurora
		|--- Social_Network_Ads.csv	The dataset used in the Aurora experiment         
	|--- CrossRec
		|--- CrossRec.ipynb		The generate Jupyter Notebook for CrossRec
		|--- CrossRecDataset.csv The dataset used in the CrossRec experiment
